      The Bangladeshi education system is unusually complex in that primary, middle, senior and tertiary education are oriented towards general, madresh (religious) or technical / vocational preferences Even private schools and universities are heavily subsidized – in fact the constitution decrees that children between ages 6 and 10 shall pay nothing. To complicate things further, local education is controlled by a hierarchy of school boards. The first phase, fully free primary school lasts for 5 years, typically between ages 6 and 10.
